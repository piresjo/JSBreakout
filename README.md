# JSBreakout

Simple Breakout Game In JavaScript

Originally, this was a project to help me relearn the basics of JavaScript (syntax, OOP, client-side web development, and some JQuery). Once I finish the basics of this game, I'll only be making changes intermittently.

To play, just download the two main game files (gamePage.html and mainGame.js) and the sprites, put the sprites in a folder called "sprites" (otherwise errors will be thrown), and run gamePage.html
